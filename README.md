# Xylophone

## Goal

The goal is to learn how to play sound and use an Apple library called AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great programmer is being able to solve your own problems. Did that by exploring StackOverflow, Apple Documentation and learning how to search for solutions effectively. By learning to use these tools, I was able to start adding custom features to the app and get it to do what I want it to.


## What I created

Created my first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. So I made a colourful XyloPhone app. 

## What I learned

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
* Functions and methods in Swift. 
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
